         <hr> <p><li> I don’t know what a necessity entrepreneur is. But maybe your potential clients know what it means? 
         That’s more important than that I understand it.  Also, it’s unclear whether you help women entrepreneurs
         or all small business owners. Better to focus on one option instead of risking confusion.</li><br><hr><li> I’m glad you enjoyed the tulips!
         The bio I used for guest posts is the one I’ve quoted above—it’s relatively short: Henneke Duistermaat is an irreverent writer
          on a mission to stamp out gobbledygook. Get your free 16-Part Snackable Writing Course for Busy People and learn how to enchant
          your readers and win more business.  Even if the host allowed a longer word count, I haven’t made the bio longer because I was
           always afraid people might lose interest. Also, they’ve already read a whole blog post so I’ve already built up some
            credibility with the advice shared in the blog post. But this is not something I’ve tested. It’s mainly based on gut feeling. </p></li></h4>
